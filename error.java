// Method Signature: The main method is declared incorrectly. The correct signature for the main method in Java is public static void main(String[] args). You have an extra "class" keyword before void.

// Scanner Initialization: When initializing a Scanner object, you need to pass System.in as the argument, not System.out.

// Input Mismatch: You are using nextDouble() and nextInt() methods to read input from the user, but you have declared the variables num1 and num2 as int. This will cause a mismatch error as nextDouble() returns a double value and nextInt() returns an int value.
